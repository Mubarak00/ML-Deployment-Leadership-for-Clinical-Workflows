# ML Deployment Leadership for Clinical Workflows

## Project Summary
Led cross-functional teams of data scientists, software engineers, and clinicians to deploy machine learning models that supported diagnostic workflows across a hospital network.

## Problem Statement
The hospital needed scalable, compliant ML solutions to assist clinicians in diagnosing complex diseases from multimodal medical data. Collaboration between technical and clinical teams was critical to success.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **Languages**: Python, SQL  
- **Cloud**: AWS (SageMaker, EC2, Lambda), Azure ML  
- **MLOps**: Docker, Flask, REST APIs, Streamlit  
- **Collaboration Tools**: Confluence, Jira, Zoom, Git  
- **Stakeholders**: Radiologists, family physicians, surgeons, data engineers

## Implementation Highlights
- Defined model requirements with clinicians and translated into engineering specs  
- Oversaw data acquisition, annotation protocols, and model development  
- Guided ML team in training and validating models under clinical constraints  
- Directed engineers on deploying models via APIs and web interfaces (e.g., Streamlit, Tableau)  
- Presented results and risks to clinical advisory board for go/no-go decisions

## Deployment Overview
```
Medical Data (Images + EMR) ─▶ Model Dev ─▶ Dockerized APIs ─▶ Clinical Frontends ─▶ Real-time Clinical Use
```

## Results & Business Impact
- Enabled real-time clinical decision support for 4+ departments  
- Achieved cross-team alignment on ML product goals and timelines  
- Facilitated deployment of models with >90% accuracy in clinical test environments

## Challenges & Learnings
- Bridging communication between clinicians and engineers was key  
- Clinical validation cycles were longer than typical model QA  
- Prioritized interpretability and UI simplicity for clinician adoption

## Team Collaboration
- 5 data scientists, 3 MLOps engineers, 6 clinicians, and 2 project managers  
- Maintained alignment through weekly demos, joint planning, and sprint retrospectives

## Code Availability
Due to clinical sensitivity and organizational NDA, model code and interfaces are not publicly available.
